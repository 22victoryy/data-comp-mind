    "In this lab, you will construct a simple cognitive model that reproduces human judgments of prototypicality about birds (see corresponding lecture notes for details, particularly the slide that shows the big list of prototypicality ratings on different birds such as sparrows and penguins, in the experiment performed by Rosch).\n",
    "\n",
    "All the essential variables have been imported for you, and please spend some time trying to understand their corresponding data structures, recorded in \"birdnames\", \"F\", \"goodness\", and \"features\", respectively. Specifically, you will be modelling prototypicality for the birds described in \"birdnames\". The feature matrix \"F\" records all the features that people have come up with for these birds, as well as the applicability of the features to the birds. Each entry in this matrix records how many participants considered a feature applies to a bird: 0 indicates that no one considered a bird to have a certain feature, and a higher count (integer) indicates that at least 1 person considered a bird to have a certain feature. You will need to use all features for your model, and all features are annotated in \"features\". Finally, \"goodness\" contains prototypicality ratings taken directly from Rosch's list as shown on the lecture slide (mentioned above). The idea of the following exercise is for you to construct a prototypicality model, such that the model-constructed prototypicality ratings for all the birds in question should ultimately correlate with the ratings recorded in \"goodness\". Note that the conceptual basis for the prototype model has been already discussed in class---see lecture notes posted.\n",
